1. Spreadsheet folder: Vanilla JS: Creating a rudimentary spreadsheet where you add/edit/delete data
2. Spreadsheet-dependency-logic folder: Express.js: Maintaining a table of cells as they are changed, keeping track of what cell they may be referencing, if any updates then push the update to all the cells that reference it (Observer Pattern)
3. HTTP-handler: TypeScript: Push previous spreadsheet logic to a server and use Typescript to send/receive requests with POST/PUT/GET/DELETE
